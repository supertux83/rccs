# rccs
Rapid CSSE COVID-19 data extractor for the SVA

This R package provides a set of functions to collect, manipulate and display CSSE / John Hopkins data related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The package is still at an early stage of development. The presence of several residual bugs is likely and the documentation is still very partial.

To install this package :
`devtools::install_github("supertux83/rccs", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

See `vignette("how-to-use-the-rccs-package", package = "rccs")` for use.
